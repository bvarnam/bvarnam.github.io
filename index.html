							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>My educational background in Mathematics and Physics has made me an excellent solver of complex problems. I took my skills upon graduation into the field of Private Equity where I utilized quantitative and qualitative methods on business and market analysis, but quickly found myself more intrigued with the database and operational efficiencies of the business I was working for. After researching and developing some data engineering & science solutions, I joined General Assemblies 12-Week, 450 hour Data Science Immersive course to acquire the tools to be truly effective and bring about significant value to any company I work for, as well as my own projects.</p>

									<h3>Kobe Shot Prediction</h3>
									<p>Originally from Kaggle, this project aims to take in game and shot data in order to predict whter or not Kobe Bryant will make his shot using multiple types of models and extensive exploratory analysis. The form of this project was a "Hackathon" done in the course of 2 days.</p>
